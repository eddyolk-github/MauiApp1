## Deployment Pipeline Details

### Android Deployment Strategy

```yaml
# Android Build & Deploy Configuration
android-deploy:
  strategy:
    development:
      - Build APK with debug configuration
      - Upload to Firebase App Distribution
      - Send notification to #dev-team Slack
      
    staging:
      - Build AAB (Android App Bundle) with release configuration
      - Upload to Google Play Internal Testing
      - Run automated UI tests on Firebase Test Lab
      
    production:
      - Build signed AAB with production configuration
      - Upload to Google Play Store (staged rollout)
      - Monitor crash reports and performance metrics
```

### iOS Deployment Strategy

```yaml
# iOS Build & Deploy Configuration  
ios-deploy:
  strategy:
    development:
      - Build IPA with development provisioning
      - Upload to Firebase App Distribution
      - Test on physical devices via TestFlight
      
    staging:
      - Build IPA with ad-hoc distribution
      - Upload to TestFlight Beta
      - External beta testing with limited users
      
    production:
      - Build IPA with App Store distribution
      - Submit to App Store Connect
      - Phased release with monitoring
```

## Security & Secrets Management

### Required Secrets (GitHub Secrets)
```bash
# Android Signing
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64      # Base64 encoded keystore file
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD    # Keystore password
ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS           # Key alias name
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD        # Key password

# iOS Signing
IOS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64      # Base64 encoded .p12 certificate
IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD    # Certificate password
IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE    # Base64 encoded provisioning profile
IOS_TEAM_ID                # Apple Developer Team ID

# App Store Deployment
GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT # JSON service account key
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY   # App Store Connect API key
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID # Issuer ID for API key

# Firebase
FIREBASE_TOKEN              # Firebase CLI token
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID         # Firebase project ID

# Notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL          # Slack webhook for notifications
TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL          # Microsoft Teams webhook
```

### Environment Variables per Stage

#### Development
```yaml
env:
  API_BASE_URL: "https://api-dev.yourapp.com"
  ENVIRONMENT: "development"
  LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
  FEATURE_FLAGS: "all_enabled"
```

#### Staging
```yaml
env:
  API_BASE_URL: "https://api-staging.yourapp.com"
  ENVIRONMENT: "staging"
  LOG_LEVEL: "info"
  FEATURE_FLAGS: "beta_features"
```

#### Production
```yaml
env:
  API_BASE_URL: "https://api.yourapp.com"
  ENVIRONMENT: "production"
  LOG_LEVEL: "warn"
  FEATURE_FLAGS: "stable_only"
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Automated Rollback Triggers
1. **Crash Rate > 5%**: Automatic rollback within 1 hour
2. **Performance Degradation > 20%**: Staged rollback over 6 hours
3. **Critical Security Issue**: Immediate rollback + emergency patch

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# Emergency rollback commands
gh workflow run rollback.yml --field version=previous
git tag -d v1.2.0  # Remove bad tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.2.0  # Remove from remote
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- App crash rate
- Performance metrics (startup time, memory usage)
- User engagement metrics
- API response times
- Security incidents

### Alert Channels
- **Critical**: Phone calls to on-call engineer
- **High**: Slack #alerts channel + email
- **Medium**: Slack #monitoring channel
- **Low**: Daily digest email

## Compliance & Governance

### Required Approvals by Environment

#### Development
- ✅ Automated (no approval needed)
- ✅ Developer can deploy directly

#### Staging  
- ✅ Lead Developer approval required
- ✅ Automated security scans must pass
- ✅ Unit tests must have >80% coverage

#### Production
- ✅ Product Manager approval required
- ✅ QA sign-off required
- ✅ Security team approval for major releases
- ✅ All automated tests must pass
- ✅ Performance benchmarks must be met

### Audit Trail
All deployments automatically logged with:
- Who triggered the deployment
- What version was deployed
- When the deployment occurred
- Which environment was targeted
- What tests were run
- Any manual approval records
