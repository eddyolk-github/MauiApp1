# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New Repository" (green button)
3. Name it: `MauiApp1` or your preferred name
4. **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create Repository"

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Configure Repository Settings

#### Enable GitHub Actions
- Go to your repository → Settings → Actions → General
- Select "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
- Save changes

#### Add Repository Secrets (Optional - for production deployment)
Go to Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add these secrets for full CI/CD functionality:

**For Google Play Store:**
- `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` - Service account JSON key
- `GOOGLE_PLAY_TRACK` - Release track (internal/alpha/beta/production)

**For Apple App Store:**
- `APPLE_ID` - Your Apple Developer ID
- `APPLE_PASSWORD` - App-specific password  
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID` - Your Apple Developer Team ID

**For Firebase App Distribution:**
- `FIREBASE_TOKEN` - Firebase CLI token
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID` - Your Firebase app ID

**For Code Quality (Optional):**
- `SONAR_TOKEN` - SonarCloud token for code analysis

### 4. Test the Pipeline

Once connected to GitHub:

1. **Make a small change** to any file
2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "🧪 Test CI/CD pipeline"
   git push
   ```
3. **Check GitHub Actions tab** in your repository
4. **Watch the pipeline run** - it will build for all platforms!

### 5. Branch Protection (Recommended)

For production repositories:
- Go to Settings → Branches
- Add rule for `main` branch:
  - ✅ Require status checks to pass
  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date
  - ✅ Require pull request reviews

## 🎯 What Happens Next

Once you push to GitHub, the CI/CD pipeline will automatically:

### On Every Push/PR:
- ✅ Build Android APK
- ✅ Build iOS app 
- ✅ Build macOS app
- ✅ Run automated tests
- ✅ Perform code quality checks
- ✅ Security vulnerability scanning

### On Push to `main`:
- 🚢 Deploy to production
- 📦 Create GitHub release
- 🏪 Upload to app stores (when configured)

### On Push to `develop`:
- 🧪 Deploy to staging environment
- 📱 Distribute to test groups
